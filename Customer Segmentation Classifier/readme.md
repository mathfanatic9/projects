# Customer Segmentation Classifier

### Overview
This project aims to build a classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict the class of unknown cases based on demographic data. The telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base into four service usage patterns, and the model will help customize offers for individual prospective customers.

### Dataset
The dataset contains demographic information such as region, age, and marital status. The target field, `custcat`, includes four classes representing customer groups:
- **Basic Service**
- **E-Service**
- **Plus Service**
- **Total Service**

### Objective
To develop a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier that can predict the membership class for new or unknown cases, enabling the company to tailor its services to individual needs.

### Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.
3. Evaluate the model's accuracy.
4. Use the trained model to predict the class of new cases.

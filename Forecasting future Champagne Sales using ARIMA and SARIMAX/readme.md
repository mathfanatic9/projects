# Forecasting future Champagne Sales using ARIMA and SARIMAX

This project aims to forecast future sales of champagne using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. The dataset used contains monthly sales data from Perrin Freres from 1964 to 1972.

### Methodology
1. *Data Cleaning*: Handle missing values and convert data types.
2. *Visualization*: Plot the time series data.
3. *Stationarity Testing*: Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
4. *Differencing*: Apply differencing to make the data stationary.
5. *Modeling*: Build ARIMA and SARIMAX models.
6. *Forecasting*: Use the models to forecast future sales.

### Results
- The ARIMA and SARIMAX models were able to forecast future sales with reasonable accuracy.
- Visualizations of the forecasts are included in the notebook.

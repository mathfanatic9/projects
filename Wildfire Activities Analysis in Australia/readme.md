# Wildfire Activities Analysis in Australia

This project analyzes historical wildfire data in Australia to understand patterns and trends in wildfire activities over time and across different regions. The analysis includes data visualization and statistical analysis using Python libraries. The dataset used in this project is sourced from IBM Developer Skills Network and contains information about wildfire activities in Australia, including the region, date, estimated fire area, fire brightness, radiative power, and confidence levels.

## Analysis

- **Trend Analysis**: Visualize changes in estimated fire area over time.
- **Regional Analysis**: Compare fire brightness and pixel counts across different regions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore relationships between fire radiative power and confidence levels.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Map wildfire activities using Folium.
 
## Dashboard

The dashboard provides an interactive way to analyze wildfire activities in Australia using Dash and Plotly. The dashboard allows users to select a region and year to visualize the monthly average estimated fire area and the average count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires. `Dash_Wildfire_Australia.py` script has been used to create and run the Dash application.

### Dashboard Features

- **Select Region**: Choose from New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia.
- **Select Year**: Choose a year to filter the data.
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Pie Chart**: Monthly average estimated fire area.
  - **Bar Chart**: Monthly average count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires.

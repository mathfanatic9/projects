# House Pricing Data Analysis

Overview:
This project aims to analyze and predict housing prices using a dataset containing house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. The dataset spans homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 and includes features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

Dataset:
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [House Sales in King County, USA] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). It includes various attributes like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of the living area, and lot size, among others.

Structure:
	• Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
	• Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the data to understand trends and patterns.
	• Model Development: Building regression models to predict house prices.
	• Model Evaluation and Refinement: Assessing and improving model performance.

Results:
The project includes several models with varying complexity, from simple linear regression to polynomial regression with pipeline construction. The models are evaluated using R-squared and cross-validation scores.

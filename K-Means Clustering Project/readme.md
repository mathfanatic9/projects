# k-Means Clustering Project on different applications

### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of k-Means clustering, one of the simplest and widely used clustering algorithms in data science. It includes two main applications: clustering a randomly generated dataset and customer segmentation.

### Dataset
The project uses a randomly generated dataset and a customer dataset from a CSV file. The customer dataset requires pre-processing and normalization before applying k-Means.

### Results
The k-Means algorithm successfully clusters the data points and reveals insights into customer segmentation, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies.

# k-Means Clustering Project on different applications

### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of k-Means clustering, one of the simplest and widely used clustering algorithms in data science. It includes two main applications: clustering a randomly generated dataset and customer segmentation.

### Dataset
The project uses a randomly generated dataset and a customer dataset from a CSV file. The customer dataset requires pre-processing and normalization before applying k-Means.

### Usage
- Import the required libraries.
- Generate a random dataset using make_blobs.
- Set up k-Means clustering with the appropriate parameters.
- Fit the k-Means model with the feature matrix.
- Create visual plots to understand the clustering.
- Load the customer dataset and preprocess the data.
- Normalize the dataset using StandardScaler.
- Apply k-Means clustering to segment customers.
- Analyze the results and gain insights into customer demographics.

### Results
The k-Means algorithm successfully clusters the data points and reveals insights into customer segmentation, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies.

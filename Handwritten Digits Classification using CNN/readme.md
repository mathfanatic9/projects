# Handwritten Digits Recognition with ANN and CNN

### Overview
This project aims to classify handwritten digits using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the MNIST dataset.

### Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each of 28x28 pixel resolution. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### Training
The models are trained using the training set with normalized pixel values ranging between 0 and 1. The ANN model is trained for 25 epochs, and the CNN model for 5 epochs.

### Evaluation
The models' performance is evaluated using the test set. The accuracy and loss metrics are plotted to assess the models' learning progress.

### Results
The CNN model outperforms the ANN model, achieving an accuracy of over 98%, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying handwritten digits.

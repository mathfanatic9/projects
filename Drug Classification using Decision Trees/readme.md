# Drug Classification Project

### Overview
This project involves the development of a classification model using the Decision Tree algorithm to predict the most suitable drug for patients based on their medical records. The model is trained on historical data of patients' responses to different medications.

### Dataset
The dataset includes patient records, each with features such as Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol levels. The target variable is the drug type that each patient responded to during their treatment.

### Features
The features include patients' age, gender, blood pressure (BP) level and cholesterol level. 

### Target
The target is the type of drug to which the patient responded.

### Model
A Decision Tree classifier is used to build the model. It is a multiclass classifier that predicts the drug type for a new patient based on the learned patterns from the training dataset.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to the medical researchers and patients who contributed to the dataset.

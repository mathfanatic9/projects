# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 

### Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical features.

### Dataset
The dataset contains 1025 entries with 14 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol levels (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca), thalassemia (thal), and the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

### Features
- Data Preprocessing: Conversion of categorical variables into dummy variables and scaling of values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization of data distributions and correlations using histograms and heatmaps.
- Model Selection: Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
- Model Evaluation: Cross-validation to determine the optimal number of neighbors for KNN and assess model performance.

### Visualization
The project includes several visualizations:
- Correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships.
- Histograms to observe the distribution of features.
- Count plot to visualize the target variable distribution.
